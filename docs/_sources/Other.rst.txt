The Function class and its children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`~siegpy.functions.Function` class is an important base class of
the SiegPy module, some of its children being the
:class:`~siegpy.eigenstates.Eigenstate` class and the
:class:`~siegpy.potential.Potential` class.

This section therefore presents this class and some of its children that
were not documented elsewhere, including the :ref:`TestFunctions` used in the
:ref:`notebooks`.
