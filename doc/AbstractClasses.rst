Abstract classes for further analytic cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some abstract classes are provided in order to simplify the implementation
of more analytic cases. Subclassing them should allow for minimum code
writing while preserving all the SiegPy functionalities.

They were, for instance, used to define the classes that are specific to the
:ref:`SWPCase`

   AnalyticBasisSet
   AnalyticEigenstates
