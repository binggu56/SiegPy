    "\n",
    "* Firstly, make sure that the completeness relation using your basis set is verified for the initial wavepacket. To that end, it is advised to use the smallest $k_{max}$ possible, so that the exact time propagation for $t = 0$ conveniently reproduces the initial wavepacket. At that point, is may not be interesting to use too small $h_k$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, once you found a suiting value for $k_{max}$, make a convergence study with respect to $h_k$. To that end, you have to make sure that decreasing $h_k$ does not change the time propagation of the wavepacket for the maximal time you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second point, remember that the RAGE theorem tells you that the continuum states contributions to the time propagation of the wavepacket vanishes in the long time limit: it might not be interesting to look at what is happening for too long times, since using only the bound states to propagate the wavepacket should suffice, while converging the exact propagation might become time-consuming because too small values for $h_k$ are required."
